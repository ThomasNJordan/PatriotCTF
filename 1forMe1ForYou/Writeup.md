# One for you, one for me

### Description
You love to order the same flag every day, but I want a flag as well. How about this, I'll split it with you. I'll take half the bits at random and flip them, keeping them all to myself! No worries, you still have half <3

### Solution
Based on the large sample of flags generated (1 million) we can infer that the least seen ascii viable character is the element of the plaintext (more details in code). 

Definately an interesting challenge and this one sentence took me over 4 hours to figure out and code.
